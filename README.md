# Block Cipher using XOR in Python
This Python script demonstrates block encryption and decryption using XOR operation.

## Instructions:
encrypt_block Function:

Accepts a block of plain text (composed of uppercase letters) and a encryption key (a sequence of uppercase letters).
Returns the encrypted block using XOR operation.
decrypt_block Function:

Accepts an encrypted block (result of XOR operation) and the same encryption key.
Returns the decrypted block.
Usage Example:

Utilize these functions with a concrete example by choosing a block of plain text and a key.
Display the encryption and decryption results.
Code Comments:

Each line of the script is commented to explain its role in the encryption and decryption process.

## Usage:
Clone the repository.
Run the Python script to observe the encryption and decryption process.
Modify the example to test different blocks of text and keys.
